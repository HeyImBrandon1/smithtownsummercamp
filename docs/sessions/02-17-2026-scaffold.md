# Session: Project Scaffold — 02/17/2026

## What Was Done
- Audited all 11 pages of existing WordPress/Elementor site (smithtownsummercamp.com)
- Captured all content word-for-word in `docs/content-audit.md`
- Found and corrected wrong camp start date (was June 6, 2025 → June 28, 2026)
- Found 28 junk blog posts from WordPress theme template (ignored)
- Found no video on existing site (user thought there was one)
- Created CLAUDE.md development framework matching project conventions
- Created 5-phase build plan in `docs/plans/smithtown-plan.md`
- Created GitHub repo at HeyImBrandon1/smithtownsummercamp
- Scaffolded full Next.js 16 + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui project from scratch
- Built all 11 content pages with original WordPress content
- Config-driven architecture: `src/config/camp.ts` + `src/config/site.ts`
- Built shared components: Section, PageHeader, CtaButton, FaqAccordion
- Built marketing components: CountdownTimer, ProgramCard, ActivityCard, PricingTable
- Built ContactForm + LeadCaptureForm → Google Sheets via Apps Script
- Contact API route with Resend email notification
- Lead capture API route
- Google Sheets client (Apps Script pattern from nycswimming)
- Zod v4 validation schemas for both forms
- Full layout: SiteHeader (with mobile nav), SiteFooter
- Camp branding colors: primary blue (#1a5276), accent orange (#ffab00)
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions
- Build passes clean ✓

## Key Decisions
- **No create-next-app** — scaffolded manually for full control
- **Apps Script for Google Sheets** — same pattern as nycswimming, no googleapis library
- **Lazy Resend init** — prevents build failure when API key not set
- **`as const` config** — camp dates, pricing, FAQ, activities all config-driven
- **Readonly types** — Activity.items is `readonly string[]` for `as const` compat

## What's Next
1. Download images from WordPress site and place in `/public/images/`
2. Install shadcn/ui components as needed (accordion, etc.)
3. GoHighLevel chatbot widget embed
4. Video embed (when URL provided)
5. Connect Vercel for deployment
6. Set up Google Sheets Apps Script + env vars
7. Polish responsive design
8. SEO metadata and structured data
